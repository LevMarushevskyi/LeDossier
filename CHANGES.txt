- SVG patterns with quadratic curves for wavy lines
- Gradients applied using SVG linearGradient with opacity
- All pages use same background color for consistency
- Responsive design using useWindowDimensions hook

BUG FIXES & CHANGES
-------------------

[2026-02-14 05:52] Fixed wavy line pattern on rectangle+triangle not persisting after navigation
  - Changed gradient mask to use proper white color stops with opacity
  - Used nested masks: shapeMask for boundary, fadeMask for gradient fade
  - Pattern now properly displays and persists across navigation

[2026-02-14 05:52] Fixed sign-in button hover animation not persisting after navigation
  - Changed gradient to use white color stops with stopOpacity instead of opacity-only stops
  - Wrapped pattern rect in mask using the gradient
  - Invalid opacity=\"url(#gradient)\" replaced with mask=\"url(#mask)\" pattern

[2026-02-14 05:52] Fixed center shape wavy pattern not persisting after navigation
  - Added state-based key to SVG element that increments on mount
  - Changed from nested masks to clipPath for shape boundary

  - Pattern now persists properly after navigation
[2026-02-14 05:52] Fixed hover animation to continue forever
  - Moved animation start to component mount instead of hover trigger
  - Animation runs continuously, hover only shows/hides the animated layers

[2026-02-14 05:52] Replaced SVG Pattern elements with direct path rendering
