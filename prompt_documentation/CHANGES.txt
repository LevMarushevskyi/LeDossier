[2026-02-14 21:00] Simplified screens to minimal components for debugging
  - Replaced Home.tsx complex SVG layout with simple Text and TouchableOpacity
  - Replaced IdeaVault.tsx complex layout with simple buttons
  - Testing if SVG components or layout complexity is causing the crash
  - If pages still disappear, issue is in navigation or React lifecycle

[2026-02-14 21:05] Identified and fixed the issue - WebGL shaders AND SVG causing crashes
  - Minimal components stay visible - confirmed issue is with WebGL shaders AND SVG components
  - Both WebGL and complex SVG components cause rendering crashes in React Native

  - For MOBILE (iOS/Android): Returns HTML that triggers deep link (ledossier://)
  - For WEB: Returns HTML that uses postMessage and localStorage for communication
  - Flask success page styled with app theme (#0C001A background, #FFFDEE text)
  - Fixed userinfo access to use oauth.oidc.userinfo() instead of token['userinfo']
  - Updated SignIn.tsx with platform detection using Platform.OS

  - Fixes issue where Flask session wasn't being cleared on logout
  - Session cookies now properly sent/received between React Native app and Flask

[2026-02-14 22:30] Fixed OAuth state mismatch error
  - Changed Flask secret key from random (os.urandom) to fixed value
  - OAuth state validation requires consistent session encryption across requests

  - Supports environment variable FLASK_SECRET_KEY for production deployment
  - Changed SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE from 'None' to 'Lax' for localhost
